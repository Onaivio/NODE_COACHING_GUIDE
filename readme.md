# WELCOME TO MY NODE JS LESSON

## What is NodeJS
    Node.js is an open source server environment, It allows you to run Javascript on servers. NodeJS can run on various platform and Operating system like (Window, Linux, MacOS, Unix, etc).

## Why Node JS
    Node.js uses asynchronous programming
    The common task for the web server can be to open a file on a server and return the content to the client this process also have to do with HTTP meaning [Hyper Text Transfer Protocol].

### Here is How PHP or ASP Handles File Resquest

    [x] Send the resquest to the computer file system.

    [x] It waits while the file system open and read the file because PHP is multi-treaded;

    [x] Returns the content to the client.

    [x] Ready to handle the next request.


### Here is How NodeJS Handles File Resquest

    [x] Send the resquest to the computer file system.

    [x] Ready to handle the next request.

    [x] When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client

NodeJS eliminate the waiting, and simply continues the next request, Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient not like PHP which is Multi-threaded, blocking, and synchronous pragromming.

## What can NodeJS do;
    Node.js can generate dynamic page content

    Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server

    Node.js can collect form data

    Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

## What is Node.js File System;
    It contains the task to be executed on certain event 

    A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server

    A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server and executed with ".js"




# MERN Stack 
    This is an simply define as M for MongoDB, E for Express, R for React, and N for NodeJS

## MongoDB 
    This is a document-based open soruce database system, which make use of the mongoose, Mangoose is a schema-based solution to model applications data, MongoDB Atlas is the fastest, easiest way get started with MangoDB  url =>  https://www.mangodb.com/cloud/atlas

## Express 
    Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. Express is the back-end part of the MEAN stack, together with the MongoDB database and the AngularJS front-end framework.

## React 
    This is a Javascript framework for building frontend application and User interfaces.  

## NodeJS 
    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. Node.js allows developers to write JavaScript code that can be executed on the server-side, which eliminates the need for a separate language to be used on the back-end. Node.js is one of the most popular JavaScript platforms for server-side programming that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily.
